* Schubert is the most toneful composer: the melody simply flows.
* Suleika leads to the unfinished symphony (probably the very first completely romantic symphony).
* Wanderer songs lead to Wanderer fantasy.
* Mahler doesn't like Schubert's music, but the A minor sonata haunted him.
* A minor quartet.
* Beethoven 9tet => Schubert 8tet
* Great symphony because it's in contrary to the "little" symphony.
* Numbering of Schubert symphony after 6th is confusing.
* 1824:贝九premiered.
* make magic from changing major/minor, already popular at the time.
* remarkable D956.

whats special about schubert

he exposes the fact that piano is mechanically poorly designed for music. 

most other composers try to find a solution that is both idiomatic and musical.

when i play his piece, i have the desire to redesign piano mechanism (and hall acoustics). for example, the first note of his first impromtus makes us imagine what a perfect concert hall should sound like. in other words, through schubert we can imagine how a world of perfection is supposed to look like`

pairing of composers, what are the differences.

the essence of the poem rather than the image of the poem.
